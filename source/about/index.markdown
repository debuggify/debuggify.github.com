Debuggify is a simple cloud based full-stack debugging service which enhances the modern web development experience.

### The Mission ###

Debugging software is hard and also time consuming process. Its involves a lot of advance technologies, techniques and tools. As the web is evolving faster than ever and so are the technologies involved in developing a website.

The websites have moved from static pages to complex web applications which depends on the following

  - Third party APIs like twitter, facebook, google etc
  - Third party libs/gems/npm/modules both in client side and server side
  - Third party Frameworks


With HTML5, CSS3, & ES6 the browsers are upgrading continuously. There is big diversity in the browser vendors. Even the different versions of same vendors doesn't have similar behavior for same api.

Due to high dependency on third party and bleeding edge browser environment, makes web application development even more complex process.

We are dedicated to build easy to use tools and technologies which helps developers not only build great and robust applications but also boost their productivity.
