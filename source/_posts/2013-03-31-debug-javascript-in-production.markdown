Today I had great time sharing my experience on javascript debugging with the [javascript ninja community](http://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-Ninjas-Bangalore/) at Bangalore

Here is the presentation

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="fc67d7b07c8701300a45123138156341" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<br/>

I will be explaining each point in details in the future posts.


I know I have abandoned the blog for long time but not any more. Stay connected for more.

Happy Debugging !!
